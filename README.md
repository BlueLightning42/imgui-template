# imgui-template
Imgui template using Vulkan with c++ bindings and SDL2.

Basically the example wouldn't compile for me so I took parts from my practice going through vulkan tutorial using the c++ bindings and edited them together unstil it compiled.
For now just displays the demo window.

using this as a starting point for other projects
